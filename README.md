# ubuntu_on_2024_asus_oled_13

When thinking of my next laptop in 2022, I wanted to continue with the Asus series, since my first Zenbook (a 2018 14" UX430U) was awesome. However, since their new models still used proprietary power plugs, I put a pin in that dream (who wants to keep around proprietary chargers when a few USB C chargers can be used by all the house's laptops!). Now it is 2025, and when I started my search for my next laptop after the sad passing of my Dell XPS, I decided to peek back at the Asus Zenbook 13, and behold: they finally sport standard USB C charging!
